                Hi, I’m Mashal, like every other human, 
                I’m deeply fascinated by the nature of our universe. 
                So that led me into a Physics degree at the University of Nottingham, 
                where I discovered how to use calculus to solve lengthy equations for various different physical phenomena. 
                Ranging from quantum dynamics to cosmology which was fun. 
                The absolute best part of my degree was in my final year when I chose to do an optional module on the philosophy of physics, 
                where I got to discuss the meaning of space, time and relativity. 
                Mostly I remember reading a very disturbing short story on time travel that I think about monthly called All you zombies. 
                Proceed with caution if you do read it, my condolences if you already have.
            </p>

                I went on to complete my master’s in Data Science at Oxford Brookes, 
                diving into research at the intersection of fluid dynamics, weather prediction, machine learning, and AI. 
                Having grown up in a generation shaped by a constant awareness of climate change, I have always understood the importance of sustainability in our everyday lives. 
                However, having completed my masters research I understand the leaps and bounds we can make in science, and engineering to help save lives 
                that could be taken by climate disasters either by looking at innovation in the energy sector or by building innovative weather prediction systems. 
                If you are interested in understanding why my masters research links to these concepts I explain more in my projects section.

                Now I’m a trainee Data Engineer at Sigma Labs, learning more about software, the cloud and data. 
                Also learning a little bit of frontend on the side; hence this website. 
                I’m looking to channel my curiosity and problem-solving energy into real-world challenges in Industry.

                Professional stuff out the way: I used to read obsessively as a kid for escapism, but that love has since transformed into a deep appreciation for film and TV, 
                to the point where, in another universe, I absolutely would’ve chased a career in film (thank you, GCSE media studies teacher). 
                I’m also unreasonably obsessed with horror, and there is a permanent section of my brain reserved exclusively for David Lynch’s Twin Peaks.

                Other things to know about me are that I worked for years as a part time barista. 
                I have a love for well crafted coffee, though right now matcha has taken over my personality after a friend brought some back from Japan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking ahead, my personal goals include travelling the world, solving the climate crisis, opening a cafe, and producing a film. 
                Eventually my ultimate goal is to travel to Peru and hike Machu Picchu; not because I'm particularly adventurous but because of a disney channel original 
                I watched as a tween (Monte Carlo). At the end of the day, I’m just someone who loves stories, ideas, and solving mysteries.
